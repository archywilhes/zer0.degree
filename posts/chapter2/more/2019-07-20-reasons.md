The set of reasons to see her

is significantly inferior than

the set of no reasons to see her

<br>

The moon is bright is not a reason to see her

She smells really nice is a reason to see her

You really enjoy the movie _her_ is not a reason to see her

She is clearly interested in you is a reason to see her

<br>

There are many reasons to see her

There are infinitely many no reasons to see her

In terms of cardinality,

the set of no reasons to see her

is infinitely greater than the set of reasons

<br>

In terms of cardinality,

the set of no reasons to do anything

is infinitely greater than the set of reasons

and yet we still do things

Reasons are overrated.
