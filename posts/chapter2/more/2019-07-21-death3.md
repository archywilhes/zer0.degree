death unto fractals

the beginning is the end

warmth from the past presents itself

as totems for those who arrived, coldly

<br>

death unto fractals

all senses disperse and commingle

and metamorphose into nothing

as they approach infinity

<br>

death unto fractals

resolution as dimension

time as a topological construct

reality as manifold

<br>

death unto fractals

recursion within recursion

correspondence corresponding correspondence

encoding encoding encoding
