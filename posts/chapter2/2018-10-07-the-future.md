No time was wasted. What was destined to be computed has been computed. The future is deterministic in the eye of itself. As a wise antique dealer would tell you, your life might as well have taken the most optimised path in a non-deterministic Turing machine of all life possibilities. What determines which is the most optimised path? That is the gate to all mystery. Those who seek mystery are forever lost, and so are those who seek the future.

After an almost endless conversation with the Hover support team, I regained access to my lost domain <code>[0a.io](http://0a.io)</code> just weeks before it would expire and disappear into the fantasy land of domain merchants. [I screwed up and lost the domain last December](https://zer0.degree/chapter2/losing-my-Hover-registered-email-and-domain.html), after which I founded [<code>zer0.degree</code> (i.e. the current website)](https://zer0.degree) as I tried to calm the fuck down and stay cool. <code>[0a.io](http://0a.io)</code> had been like an identity to me. I was devastated. But it was a wake-up call too. I realised aside from showing people that my email is <code>[a@0a.io](http://0a.io)</code>, there were no other means I could efficiently convey to people how cool I am. I was rejected by Yale. I had never finished any cool projects I started. I had never worked in a company cool to be an employee of. The domain and email address had served as the very foundation of my coolness since I was 17.

When this foundation of coolness collapsed last December, it was also the month my ex girlfriend decided to dump me, and, just when I thought things couldn't get any worst, a middle age researcher in developmental psychology who I considered a friend and had a lot of respect for turned out to be a Machiavellian who was offering me condolences while passive-aggressively trying to convince me to work for him for free. I grieved for the domain, vowed to forget the girl, and deleted the friendship with the researcher. It was impossible for me to foresee a future 10 months from then when not only would I get back my lost domain, I would be [co-founding arguably the coolest start-up in Singapore, working on Augmented Reality and other CS vision and graphics technologies whilst building a social platform for art people](https://castella.art).

All the missing business, social and tech pieces are gradually falling into place and rapidly hot-swapping in unfathomable ways. We are as confident we are going to inspire a lot of people as we are skeptical if any of this will work.
