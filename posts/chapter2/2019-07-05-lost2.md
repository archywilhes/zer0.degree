What is lost remains hidden in plain sight

the same way quantum information is retained

beyond the event horizon

<br>

The protagonist touches time and plays with her tail

and takes acid to keep himself sane

in the holographic world

<br>

Nothing is lost

for everything is already broken

and so is nothing

<br>

As we approach death

and become one with nothing

we become one

<br>

Love is a bottomless pool of acid

Goals are the guardians

and death its essence

<br>

Excavate meaning from the future

Detach tesserae from the past

The present is a paradoxical amusement

<br>

Nothing is lost

the same way everything is

We are conglomerates of debris
