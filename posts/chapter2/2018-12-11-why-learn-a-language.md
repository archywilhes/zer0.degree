>I was in Tibet last year and made friend with a middle-aged Tibetan Doctor from whom I got to know an old German photographer, perhaps the only person from Germany that was issued a Tibetan permanent residency - yes, I was in disbelief upon hearing about that so I demanded proof from him, to which he took out from his wallet a piece of paper no larger than 20 cm squared meter, aged to a degree you could tell it’s slightly oxidated, stamped with red ink indicating the authenticity of the right given to this man who had attached on this very piece of paper his passport photo and filled up and his name and some personal information like where he is from: Germany. Just like all Germans, he is fluent in many languages, and especially astounding in his case as among which are Chinese and Cantonese. We didn’t have much time to converse as he was in a hurry to catch the sky of that particular night. The Tibetan sky, he told me, was the primary reason for why he lives here. The Tibetan language, he told me on the other hand, as a part of the response to my curiosity regarding his opinions on how hard picking up Tibetan would be for Sino-Anglophone - I had been toying with the idea of picking up Tibetan as my forth language - is not worth learning as your fourth language. Maybe as your tenth, he added, and maybe not to learn the one used by modern day Tibetan people but the one in the scriptures for your archaeological amusement, you see, in this day and age men who only speak Tibetan here have only three hobbies: drinks, talks about politics and plays the dice game.

Why learn a new language? Or more formally, how to justify the investment spent on accustoming oneself to a particular unfamiliar linguistic system? I have been contemplating about it for a while now. The justification depends a lot on the degree of accustomation you want to achieve. Let’s assume accustomation to a degree that either one holds:

1. you can pass a variation of the Turing test: write an essay in the new language without using a bilingual dictionary (on the other hand, the use of a corpus, etc, is allowed) and convince your readers that you are a native speaker.

2. you are be able to have deep and meaningful conversations in the new language with native speakers without relying on a translator.

<br>
In my opinions a proper justification would have to consist at least two points below. The more points the justification contains the more you can convince yourself to learn that particular new language.

1. Category: Love
    1. To communicate better
    2. To masterfully flirt with her or him
    3. To get more turned on by her or his native language on bed
    4. To share deeper idiosyncratic moments together such as getting a cultural or linguistic reference immediately in a punny joke of the native language of hers or his
2. Category: Work and Life
    1. Better access to a particular talent pool (in hiring)
    2. Better job opportunities (in being hired)
    3. Deepen connections with the native speakers
    4. To partake in a subculture
3. Category: Personal reason
    1. To start a revolution (e.g. [Ho Chi Minh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ho_Chi_Minh))
    2. To translate interesting things (e.g. [Richard Wilhelm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richard_Wilhelm_(sinologist)))
    3. To be a missionary
    4. To impress the media (e.g. [Daniel Tammet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Tammet))

<br>

Note: the list intensionally excludes "To better appreciate a certain work in their native language." That can certainly be an interesting experience (e.g. reading [Gödel's proof](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del%27s_incompleteness_theorems) in German, reading [Italo Calvino](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italo_Calvino) in Italiano, watching Anime in Japanese) but for humans that is just not too convincing of a factor. Engaging in these activities can certainly facilitate the process of acquiring the new language, but they lack the social and romantic elements to be convincing enough a justification for self-persuasion to endeavour.
