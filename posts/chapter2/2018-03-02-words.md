A closer look into the smallest meaningful units in any language i.e. words reveals that they are ambiguous in terms of the variations one can associate feelings with a word and the degree of freedom the meanings and concepts each can encapsulate. Nonetheless each word functions as a concrete entity with a beginning and an end. So to speak within the essence of every word lies the improvised generalisation akin to a fuzzy protocol serving as the ultimate termination of a mental process. So when we put things into words we are searching heuristically for the right terms to convey a feeling or thought and while doing so we are reshaping the very feelings and thoughts themselves in the process. Fascinating. And very intriguing.

It is thus no surprise after a prolonged process of construction we would often end up with sentences and linguistic constructs that remotely resemble what we might have initially preconceived. And from that we can already have a sense of why editing is rather fundamental if you want to deliver something comprehensive and comprehensible for others to read.
