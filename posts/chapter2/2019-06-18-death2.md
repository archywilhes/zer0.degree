Every time we grow a little bit conscious about the realistic notion of our death, we become a little bit more serious towards what the remaining future of our time in existence ought to look and feel like. Goals surface themselves like shipwreck on desert. These goals are where meaning can be derived from. In many ways these goals promise us infinities and yet these goals donâ€™t co-exist well with infinities in the sense that infinities tend to desert them. After all, they are not in good terms with romanticism and our love for heuristic wandering as everything else unrelated to the execution towards these goals can feel like a waster of time. But what is time without infinity? That is the question that has troubled Jobs, Zuckerburg, Thiel and Elon.

Infinity is a mistress. She toys with our feelings while rendering us amnesiac and apathetic towards the future. She is the manifestation of the present in its purest sense. She is what orgasm feels like without its subsequent death. She is what the commitment to suicide encapsulates without the impurities. To truly be a master of yourself is to master infinity the way one masters a slave.

Society is constantly at war with itself. After all, society exists to operate a system the same way that our social tendencies are merely genetic expressions under computation. From a goal-orientated point of view they can be a waste of time and yet they are useful in terms of the joy they spark, etc, and the human relations formed thereafter. But not all joys are useful towards fulfilling our goals the same way not all human relations worth our time. Most humans are extremely unintelligent after all (especially to you who are appreciating my writings). And even if they are intelligent in one aspect or another, such intelligence is rarely expressed in social functions unless you are having a cocktail party in a seminar where everyone knows one another and assumes everyone is as intelligent and curious as themselves and you don't like elegant Feynman mystifying himself.

In order to truly master both infinites and social intercourses, the art of sociopathic behaviours needs to be learned and employed. We ought to appreciate sociopathic behaviours for they demonstrate a somewhat absolute control of self and the wonderful acknowledgement regarding the transient nature of time. After all, death awaits us but we need to learn when to leave infinities behind for other infinites or the promises for there exists only a limited amount of time.

And we ought to take care of our health. And take caution towards our empathetic inclination. But what about love? Oh, that is the gate to all mystery.
