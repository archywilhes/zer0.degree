Every time we grow a little bit conscious about the realistic notion of our death, we become a little bit more serious towards what song should be played in our funeral and what the remaining future of our time in existence ought to look and feel like. In the face of death goals surface themselves like shipwrecks on desert. These goals are where meaning can be derived from. In many ways these goals promise us infinities. But infinities tend to desert goals. After all, goals are not in good terms with romanticism and our love for heuristic wandering and the wonderful practice of not doing. Everything unrelated to the execution towards these goals can feel like a waste of time. But what is existential time without infinity? That is the question that has troubled Jobs, Zuckerburg, Thiel and Elon.

Infinity is a mistress. She toys with our feelings while rendering us amnesiac and apathetic towards the future. She is the manifestation of the present in its purest form. She is what orgasm feels like without its subsequent death. She is what the commitment to suicide encapsulates without the impurities. To truly be a master of yourself is to master infinity the way one masters a slave.

Society is constantly at war with itself. After all, society exists to operate systems the same way our social tendencies are merely genetic expressions under computation. From a classical goal-orientated point of view most forms of socialisation can be viewed as a waste of time. Nonetheless socialisation is in general nice in terms of the joy it sparks, etc, and the human relations formed in the long run. But not all joys are useful towards fulfilling our goals the same way not all human relations worth our time. Most humans are extremely unintelligent after all (especially to you, my dear friend, who somewhat appreciates my writings). And even when some are intelligent (or artistically inclined in the sense wherefrom intelligence can be derived) in one aspect or another, such intelligence and artsiness are rarely expressed in social functions containing more than 2 persons. Overall, meeting strangers is fun. But further social intercourses with the same strangers (who gradually lose, for the lack of a better word, _strangeness_) risks dilution into uneventfulness. And that, my dear friend, is the melancholic nature of socialisation.

In order to truly master infinites in a society's setting, the art of strategical sociopathic behaviours (i.e. the behavioural deviation from social norms and antisocial patterns in general, in a somewhat game theoretical framework) needs to be learned and employed. We ought to appreciate sociopathic behaviours for they demonstrate a somewhat absolute control of self and the wonderful acknowledgement regarding the transient nature of time. After all, death awaits us all and we ought to learn when to leave some infinities behind for other infinites, or momentarily abandon infinities for the sweet promises derived from goals that reflect the future we look forwards to. Even if the act of doing so may hurt others a little. Even if the act of doing so may hurt our soul a little. Time is limited. Strategical sociopathic behaviours work wonders in constrained optimisation problems<sup>[1]</sup>.

And we ought to take care of our health. And take caution towards our empathetic inclination. Empathy is a double-edged sword. The trick here is not to point it to yourself nor to the world but to appreciate the elegance of its craft. What about love and the cautionary tales of hopeless romanticism, you may ask. Should we take precautions towards that too? Oh, my dear friend, that is the gate to all mystery.

And those who seek mystery are forever lost â˜¯
