Every time we grow a little bit conscious about the realistic notion of our death, we become a little bit more serious towards what song should be played in our funeral and what the remaining future of our time in existence ought to look and feel like. In the face of death goals surface themselves like shipwreck on desert. These goals are where meaning can be derived from. In many ways these goals promise us infinities and yet these goals donâ€™t co-exist well with infinities in the sense that infinities tend to desert them. After all, these goals are not in good terms with romanticism and our love for heuristic wandering as everything unrelated to the execution towards these goals can feel like a waster of time. But what is time without infinity? That is the question that has troubled Jobs, Zuckerburg, Thiel and Elon.

Infinity is a mistress. She toys with our feelings while rendering us amnesiac and apathetic towards the future. She is the manifestation of the present in its purest sense. She is what orgasm feels like without its subsequent death. She is what the commitment to suicide encapsulates without the impurities. To truly be a master of yourself is to master infinity the way one masters a slave.

Society is constantly at war with itself. After all, society exists to operate systems the same way that our social tendencies are merely genetic expressions under stimuli-based computation. From a goal-orientated point of view they can be a waste of time and yet they are useful in terms of the joy they spark, etc, and the human relations formed thereafter. But not all joys are useful towards fulfilling our goals the same way not all human relations worth our time. Most humans are extremely unintelligent after all (especially to you who somewhat appreciate my writings). And even if some are intelligent in one aspect or another, such intelligence is rarely expressed in social functions containing more than 2 people, unless you are having a cocktail party in a seminar where everyone knows one another and assumes everyone is as intelligent and curious and respectful as themselves.

In order to truly master both infinites and social intercourses, the art of sociopathic behaviours needs to be learned and employed. We ought to appreciate sociopathic behaviours for they demonstrate a somewhat absolute control of self and the wonderful acknowledgement regarding the transient nature of time. After all, death awaits us and we need to learn when to leave infinities behind for other infinites or the promises for there exists only a limited amount of time. Sociopathic behaviours work wonders in constrained optimisation problems.

And we ought to take care of our health. And take caution towards our empathetic inclination. But what about love, you may ask. Oh, that is the gate to all mysteries.
