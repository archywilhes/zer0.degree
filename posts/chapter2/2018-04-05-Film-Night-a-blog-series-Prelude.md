Have been single for half a year now, after an 18 months of craze that ended in bitter tongues. So all of a sudden I have more time than Iâ€™m used to when not on the road.

I want to do a little experiment here. I want to see if I can convince myself to watch a film before bed each night when I'm taking a break from travelling and social intercourses. And write about it.

That can be nice.
