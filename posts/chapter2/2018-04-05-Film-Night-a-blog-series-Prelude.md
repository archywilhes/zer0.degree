Have been single for half a year now, after an 18 months of craze that ended in bitter tongues. So all of a sudden I have more time than I’m used to when not on the road.
<!--more-->

I want to do a little experiment here. I want to see if I’m able to convince myself to watch a feature-length film before bed each night. And write about it. There will sure be many hectic nights that I can’t. But for the nights that are not so hectic I want to leave some traces. That the night didn’t just disappear like it always did. That though in solitude I was with a made-belief world and left down some words about it.

That can be nice.
