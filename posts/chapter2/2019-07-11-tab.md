one and a half tab

and I will be fine

one and a half tab

and I will forget about the girl

and dance with the plants

and let the darkness segue into reality

as reality devours itself

The moon was surprisingly bright tonight

one and a half tab

and I'm leaving

Am I going to die?

or have I been long dead

from the many tabs I took that night?

<br>

one and a half tab

and I will be able to kill myself

and I will be able to change the world

if the world is worthy of itself

Am I worthy of myself?

what about the girl that was pregnant?

what about my unborn child?

<br>

one and a half tab

and her death will not have been in vain

and so won't mine

nothing is in vain

the same way everything is.

one and a half tab

and I will taste all the sorrow in this world

and I will appreciate the shapes of the shapeless

and I will have visions without visuals

and hear music as fractals

of embedded memories, encoded recursively

<br>

one and a half tab

and I will play doctor with my tormented soul

and I will enslave the future

I am the Chief Technology Officer
