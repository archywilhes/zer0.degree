Things seldom go according to plans. Even when they did they turned out in ways never could you have foreseen. Life unfolds itself mysteriously. Practice not-doing, and everything will fall into place. Learn to comprehend so you can attempt uncomprehending afterwards. Let there be nothing so you can amuse yourself with something later on.

After many years without New Year's resolutions it is only natural to get back to it the same manner a child gets back to his broken toy to remind himself that it once worked - let it be a false memory or not - so he can continue the make-believe, and continue the story. My New Year’s Resolution this year, as ludicrous as it perhaps sounds, is to have a net worth of at least a few million in SGD. Be it just the number for the cap on a [SAFE](https://www.ycombinator.com/documents/). Matters not. I can worry about the actualisation into real cash afterwards.

The plan for 2018 is to ship at least two projects each month. To demonstrates my skills and capabilities as a computational machine. Of one of the most advanced models out there. To establish a presence. And to bring forth recognition. I will execute aggressively but with no haste. Like water moving swiftly but in an unhurried fashion. As I pick up momentum along the way I would attend confs and meet-ups and interact with other humans in a heuristic search for collaborators and comrades. I will explore every business domain and industry I can explore and keep conducting experiments until I meet the right people and build the right product in the right market with the right executions and co-found a start-up of such calibre that angels and VCs approach to invest, instead of the other way round.

With [zer0.degree](http://zer0.degree) now completed, I will get [Archy](http://archy.sh/) done before [EmTech Asia](http://emtechasia.com/). And that’s it for January.
