Words

Take a closer look into words themselves and we would realise that they are ambiguous in terms of the variations one can associate feelings with a word and the meanings and concepts they encapsulate and the same time very concrete as an entity with a beginning and an end. They provide some sort of generalisation and an ultimate termination of thoughts. So when we put things into words we are searching heuristically for the right terms to convey a feeling or a thought and reshaping the internal feelings and thoughts in the process until it halts.

It is no surprise that often after a prolonged process of construction we end up with sentences that remotely resembles what we initially preconceived. And that is the beauty of putting things into words.
