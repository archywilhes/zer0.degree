future corpses

waking up each day

just so can someday be dead

<br>

death is all around us

in every breath we breathe

every emotion we express

<br>

in every sense we experience

nerve cells fire and deteriorate and die

neural networks form and deform and dissipate

<br>

in every utterance we make

every rhythm we play

every moment we live

<br>

in every pain we feel

every joy and sadness and excitement there is

we died and are replaced by the upcoming frame

<br>

the smoothness in each death

is both beautiful and sad

and very liberating

<br>

Consciousness is a continuation of discontinued frames

Time is a topological construct

The present is an open set

<br>

In a n-dimensional disconnected manifold

recursion takes place

in continuation-passing style<sup><a href="#words">[1]</a></sup>
