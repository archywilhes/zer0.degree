future corpses

waking up each day

just so can someday be dead

<br>

death is all around us

in every breath we breathe

every emotion we express

<br>

in every sense we experience

nerve cells fire and deteriorate and die

neural networks form and deform and dissipate

<br>

in every utterance we make

every rhythm we play

every moment we live

<br>

in every pain we feel

every joy and sadness and excitement there is

we meet death and are replaced by the next frame

<br>

how liberating

the smoothness in each death

the continuation of discontinued frames

<br>

Time is a topological construct

The present is a clopen set

In a n-dimensional totally disconnected space

recursion is encoded in continuation-passing style<sup><a href="#words">[1]</a></sup>
