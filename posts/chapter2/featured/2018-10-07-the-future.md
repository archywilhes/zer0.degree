No time was wasted. What was destined to be computed has been computed. The future is deterministic in the eye of itself. As a wise antique dealer would tell you, your life might as well have taken the most optimised path in a non-deterministic Turing machine of all life possibilities. What of is the path most optimised in terms? That is the gate to all mystery. Those who seek mystery are forever lost, and so are those who seek the future.

Perchance I am now back on track again to attempt another intersection with something great. With my dear [sister](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fZ1Jxef2hiE) this time. All the right pieces are gradually falling into place as they rapidly hot-swap in unfathomable ways. We are as confident we are going to inspire people and positively impact the world as we are skeptical if any of this makes sense. When the fascination for what shall arise has attached itself firmly to the precautionary tales of what shan't, the prophecies collapse and the Tao remains undefined and truthful to its ontological amusement.

Hence it is said that the future can't be distinguished from the past.
