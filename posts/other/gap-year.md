I used to entertain myself with naïve thoughts about how <span class="pacificoText">Chapter 2</span> would begin. At one point I was pretty determined it'd begin with my enrolment into a grad school as I bypassed formal undergrad studies. Or more ambitiously, in the event that I design an [algorithmic-game-theoretical](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~sandholm/cs15-892F13/algorithmic-game-theory.pdf)-based trading bot to exploit the Chinese stock market. Or a more recent thought, in the event that I start an AI research lab with a middle-aged scientist from Italy I met while travelling in China in early 2016.

None of the events've occurred, and I've ended up delaying <span class="pacificoText">Chapter 2</span> by taking a gamble with the scientist, and investing wholeheartedly in a romantic relationship with a beautiful girl I met in a Sino-Russian equinox party. The scientist, despite having a decent peer-reviewed publication record with 700+ citations, turned out to be a self-delusional hypocrite. And the girl, despite having one of the most beautiful smiles I've ever seen, turned out to be the main source of my self-hatred inducing a spiral of depressive behaviours in the next 20 months. Nonetheless they had both taught me a lot in many aspects of life I would otherwise reckon as a pure waste of time. And thanks to them I managed to gain a deeper insight into my own behaviour patterns and reactive tendencies towards various external and internal stimuli. But the truth remains that both the gamble and investment didn't yield what I had expected. I can't afford to lose any more time.

The actual <span class="pacificoText">Chapter 2</span> begins with my resignation from the position of CEO with 0% vested share in a start-up I cofounded half a year ago with the scientist and a UK professor, after the previous start-up we worked in for more than a year failed miserably with €40k seed investment. I resigned because I failed to come into consensus with the professor in the decision to dismiss the scientist and repurchase his share, which was the only logical thing to do considering the scientist has done more harm than good and is highly inadequate as a start-up co-founder.

I am glad I am on my own now. I would make it right this time.
