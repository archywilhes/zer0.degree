<b>Hi, Iâ€™m Archy Will He</b>. I'm a Gen Z school drop-out. Currently working as an engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://debuild.co">Debuild</a>, and part-time making <a target="_blank" href="https://lo.fish">lo.fish</a>, an open-source clubhouse alternative with 90s vibe.

In my free time I write about coding, languages, and consciousness, and try to figure out how to tackle [these questions](/questions/).

I live in Singapore and Shanghai, and will move to San Francisco soon. My Twitter is <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ArchyWillHe">@ArchyWillHe</a> and my email is a@0a.io (I respond to every email!)

My aim in life is to be an astronaut and settle down on Mars.
