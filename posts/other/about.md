<b>Hi, I’m Archy, aka Qi (奇)</b>. I'm a Gen Z school drop-out. Currently working as an engineer at <a target="_blank" href="https://debuild.co">Debuild</a>. In my free time I do [small research on stuff](/research/) and write about coding, languages, and consciousness.

I live in Singapore and Shanghai, and will move to San Francisco soon. My Twitter is <a target="_blank" href="http://twitter.com/ArchyWillHe">@ArchyWillHe</a> and my email is a@0a.io (I respond to every email!)

[Here](/questions/) is an on-going list of questions I would like to build products around in the next 10 years.
