These questions keep me awake at night and help me wake up in the morning. If they do the same to your circadian rhythm, I'd love to hear from you!

<br/>

<b>How can we slow down the rate at which the brain deteriorates e.g. through the use of psychedelics?</b> [It has been found that the volume of the brain declines with age at a rate of ~5% per decade after age 40. The rate of decline speeds up especially after age 70.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2596698/) Assume by 2070 human life expendency would reach 150. If we can slow down brain deterioration rate we can get exponentially more things done in our lifetime.

<br/>

<b>How are qualia constructed computationally?</b> Qualia can perhaps be understood as "tainted" representations of our sensory data composed with information about our physiology and mental states. Chemical compounds that target [G protein-coupled receptors](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBSo_GFN3qI) (e.g. [5HT2A](<https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674(20)31066-7.pdf>)) such as THC, psilocybin, LSD, etc, are able to alter our subjective experience significantly, causing qualia to be constructed slightly differently (or vastly depending on the dosage). From a functional programming perpsecitve, this is akin to [performing transformation at a semantic level](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/3-540-55253-7_8) on recursive functions. This begs the question, can we study qualia as a typed system? Are qualia consumed by [a meta-circular interpreter](http://wiki.c2.com/?MetaCircularEvaluator) which is how _awareness_ manifests itself? How can we construct new forms of qualia by combining psychedelics with brain-computer interface for a more integrated human-machine symbiosis?

<br/>

<b>Is there “an outside”?</b> Our world is a strange one. Anyone with an appreciation for maths, or physics, biology, etc, would agree. And what makes it even stranger is this subjective experience of _being_ that is a whole world of its own. That makes one wonder, is there "an outside" to this whole thing? If we as a species can come to our senses that there is something more to this world, and that what we experience in each of our existence is but a small part of something much greater shared by all sentient beings, will we then be able to collectively reduce all unnecessary suffering in this world (which is perhaps not a feature but a bug)... and reach the other side?

<br/>

<b>What is music?</b> Music is one of the greatest things in this world and yet nobody truly understands it. Do higher forms of consciousness (e.g. [Type Ω civilization](https://youtu.be/rhFK5_Nx9xY?t=187)) enjoy a class of abstractions that is the equivalent of music in this category?
