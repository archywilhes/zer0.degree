Some people kill themselves to restore honor. Some people kill themselves to end their suffering. Some people kill themselves because life is meaningless. Some people kill themselves as a form of protest. Behind every committed suicide there are surely many uniquely fascinating circumstances. As much as it is sad by it is very beautiful too because every suicide demonstrates a strong sense of self and the determination for an immediate exit from this depressive little world.

From a computational point of view, the act of ending one's own life involves an uninterrupted sequence of state-transition in the neural networks to result.
