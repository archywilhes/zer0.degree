**[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903)** A double-inductive proof of Moessner's theorem (2016)

**[preorder book](mailto:​a@0a.io)** Meta-circular Interpreter and 4 things from PLT that help me to code more productively (2022)

The following is a list of books and papers that have impacted my life profusely. I hope one day I too will have the knowledge and insights to produce work that would inspire and impact people.

<br/>

The Grand Design (2010) - Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow
<br/>

> This was the book that gave me the courage to drop out of school at 16. The realization that no one truly undestands how the fabric of our reality works is awe-inspiring. In the face of reality and its strangeness and eerily mathematical elegance, dropping out of school becomes a trivial decision one has to make to regain the autonomy of their adolescent life.
