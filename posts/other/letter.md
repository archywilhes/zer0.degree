Hi you-who-happen-to-be-here,
Thanks for dropping by. Cool to see you here :)

My name is Archy Wilhes (魏·何). Currently I’m in the midst of a decade-long journey to get into grad school without a bachelor’s degree. My research interests lie primarily in the areas of automated reasoning and artificial intelligence. When I was 19 I have [reduced a conjecture in combinatorics to a UNSAT problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02334) and [come up with a new proof for the Moessner's theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903).

I've spent more than half of my life writing code (started at the age of 10) and designing things. I've co-founded two start-ups both of which failed. At the moment I’m co-founding a third one and keeping myself afloat with freelance work as a web and app developer and designer.

My current rate is ~€60 euro an hour. Drop me an email if you happen to be looking for someone to get things done quick and high-quality.

I move around a lot. Living in at least 12 different cities each year. Currently I'm travelling in Vietnam. Will be back in Singapore next and heading to Guangzhou and Hong Kong afterwards. Feel free to drop me an email if you just wanna meet up and grab coffee or lunch together or something :) I’m a bipolar ambivert. While I'm not in my own world I enjoy meeting people and making new friends.

I can speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently. Currently I’m looking to pick up Japanese as my forth language. Would totally shelve my start-up and get rooted for a good two, three years if a nice job offer in Tokyo ever comes to me.

Live Long and Prosper,
Archy Wilhes
