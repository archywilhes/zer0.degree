Hi there.

Thanks for dropping by.

It's nice to know that you are somehow interested to learn more about me. At the moment I'm still just a nobody. I've cofounded two start-ups both of which failed and now I'm trying to start a third one. I've spent more than half of my life writing code and designing things. I believe the multidisciplinary approach to everything is both the key to new discoveries and the best excuse to immerse oneself with knowledge in every field of science and art.

One thing I want to accomplish in this life is to make true AI a reality. Possessing the right knowledge and information would enable one to extrapolate new theories. But that is vastly different from turning something into reality which requires implementations at its core. And implementations only arise from interactions with the _interfaces to reality_, which is often resource-expensive.

Now that I'm 22 my primary focus is on gathering these resources and meeting cool and great humans along to way to establish connections that would further extend the _interfaces to reality_ and help with the resource gathering.

Live Long and Prosper,
Archy Wilhes 魏何
