Hi there.

Thanks for dropping by.

It's very nice of you to come here to learn more about me. At the moment I'm just a nobody. I've cofounded two start-ups both of which failed and I'm now looking to start a third one. I've been writing code and designing things for more than half of my life. That makes me a constant slave of my start-up ideas. I believe the multi-disciplinary approach is the only key to innovations, making it the best justification for needlessly immersing oneself with knowledge and information in every human thing out there, which is what I often do when I'm not getting things done.

One thing I want to accomplish in this life is to make true AI a reality. Possessing the right knowledge and information would enable one to extrapolate new theories and form new thought, and that is nice. But turning something into reality requires implementations at its core. And some implementations arise only from interactions with _the interfaces to the human realm_. Time-consuming aside such interactions can be very resource-expensive, especially when it involves operations and real estate.

Now that I'm 22 my primary focus is on gathering these resources and meeting cool humans along to way to establish connections that would further extend _the interfaces to the human realm_ and help with the resource gathering.

Live Long and Prosper,<br/>
