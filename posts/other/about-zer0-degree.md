We are living in a strange time right now. More and more things are being treated as arcane wizardry in our society. As technology advances and evolves, systems are getting complicated.

My name is Archy Wilhes 魏何. [Zer0.degree](http://zer0.degree/) is a personal project of mine that aims to make knowledge more accessible to the public by presenting them with pictures and animated gifs in the simplest way possible.. It is scheduled to be launched in mid February, 2018.

For the web development enthusiasts out there, [Zer0.degree](http://zer0.degree/) is handcrafted by Archy Wilhes 魏何 using a static site generating library written in Haskell. Source code available [here](https://github.com/archywilhes/zer0.degree).
