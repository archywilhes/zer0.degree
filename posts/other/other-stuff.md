1. I had formally reduced the [Erd√∂s-Szekeres conjecture](http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/erdos_szekeres_conjecture) into a [constraint unsatisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02334)] && formulated a new proof for the [Moessner's theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoessnersTheorem.html) with double induction [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903)] && completed a Ph.D. module in Programming Language Theory - all these when I was 19. And then I lost my virginity.

2. I started coding at 12. I founded my first start-up at 16 (back in 2012, after dropping out from [Catholic High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_High_School,_Singapore)) and eight months later it died. I began freelancing & working for different start-ups since then.

3. I was the lead developer & shareholder of a start-up that got into the Startup Battle in TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016. Still, just like most start-ups it ran out of its runway eventually and died.

4. I speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently. But most importantly, I use [emacs](http://spacemacs.org/) -)

5. And lastly, here is a photo of me staring into your soul (in case you want to know how I look like because parts of your brain that can be traced back to the hunter-gathering times would love to encode my face into your memory as it is so much easier to associate a name with a face than the abstract notion of a human):
