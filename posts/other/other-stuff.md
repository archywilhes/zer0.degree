1. Here are some stuff I did when I was 19 that are worth mentioning: formally reducing the Erdös-Szekeres conjecture into a constraint unsatisfiability problem [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02334)] && coming up with a new proof the Moessner's theorem [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903)] && completing a Ph.D. module in Programming Language Theory.

2. I can speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently. Currently I’m studying Japanese as a hobby, thinking about picking it up as my forth language. Looking to live in Tokyo for a good few years in the near future.
