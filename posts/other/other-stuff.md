1. I had formally reduced the [Erd√∂s-Szekeres conjecture](http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/erdos_szekeres_conjecture) into a [constraint unsatisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02334)] && formulated a new proof for the [Moessner's theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoessnersTheorem.html) with double induction [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903)] && completed a Ph.D. module in Programming Language Theory - all these when I was 19. And then I lost my virginity.

2. I started coding and doing web-design at 12. I founded my first start-up at 16 (back in 2012, after dropping out from [Catholic High School](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_High_School,_Singapore)) and eight months later it died. I began freelancing & working for different start-ups since then.

3. I speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently while constantly entertaining the idea of picking up Japanese and German.

4. And lastly, you can <a id="clickHereDesu" style="color:rgb(18, 129, 219);cursor:pointer" onClick="showImages()">click here</a> for a photo of me staring into your soul.
<br/>
<br/>
<div id="images-desu" style="display:none">
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/img/Archy Wilhes.jpg" style="width:312px;max-width:100%">
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
me when I was pitching to VCs:
<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/img/Archy Wilhes1.jpg" style="width:400px;max-width:100%">
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
me when I was pitching to VCs again, with more light this time:
<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/img/Archy Wilhes1.5.jpg" style="width:400px;max-width:100%">
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
and me when I was pushing code to production to fix a really horrible bug:
<br/>
<br/>
<div style="text-align:center">
<img src="/img/Archy Wilhes2.jpg" style="width:400px">
</div>
<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
Live Long and Prosper,<br/>
Archy Wilhes
</div>

<script>
function showImages(){
    var a = document.getElementById("images-desu")
    a.style.display = "block"
    var b = document.getElementById("clickHereDesu")
    b.style.color = "black"
    b.style.cursor = "default"
}
