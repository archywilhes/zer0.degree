1. I had formally reduced the [Erd√∂s-Szekeres conjecture](http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/erdos_szekeres_conjecture) into a [constraint unsatisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02334)] && come up with a new proof the [Moessner's theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoessnersTheorem.html) with double induction [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903)] && completed a Ph.D. module in Programming Language Theory - all these when I was 19. And then I lost my virginity.

2. I speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently. Would love to pick up German and Japanese.
