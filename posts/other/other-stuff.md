1. I had formally reduced the [Erd√∂s-Szekeres conjecture](http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/erdos_szekeres_conjecture) into a [constraint unsatisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02334)] && come up with a new proof for the [Moessner's theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoessnersTheorem.html) with double induction [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903)] && completed a Ph.D. module in Programming Language Theory - all these when I was 19. And then I lost my virginity.

2. I started coding at 11. I founded my first start-up at 16 (back in 2012, after dropping out from [Catholic High](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_High_School,_Singapore)) and eight months later it died. I began freelancing & working for different start-ups since then.

3. I was the lead developer & shareholder of a start-up that got into the Startup Battle in TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016. Still, just like most start-ups it died eventually.

4. I speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently. But most importantly, I run [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_is_the_best) and [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) -)
