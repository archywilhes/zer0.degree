1. I had formally reduced the Erd√∂s-Szekeres conjecture into a constraint unsatisfiability problem [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02334)] && come up with a new proof the Moessner's theorem with double induction [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903)] && completed a Ph.D. module in Programming Language Theory - all these when I was 19. And then I lost my virginity.

2. I speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently. Would love to pick up German and Japanese.
