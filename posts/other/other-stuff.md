1. Something I did worth mentioning when I was 19: [a formal reduction a conjecture in combinatorics to a UNSAT problem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02334) and somehow [come up with a new proof for the Moessner's theorem](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903).

2. I can speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently. Currently Iâ€™m picking up Japanese as my forth language. Looking to live in Japan for a good few years.
