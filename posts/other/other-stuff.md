1. I had formally reduced the [Erd√∂s-Szekeres conjecture](http://www.openproblemgarden.org/op/erdos_szekeres_conjecture) into a [constraint unsatisfiability problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1511.02334)] && come up with a new proof for the [Moessner's theorem](http://mathworld.wolfram.com/MoessnersTheorem.html) with double induction [[pdf on arxiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/1602.01903)] && completed a Ph.D. module in Programming Language Theory - all these when I was 19. And then I lost my virginity.

2. I started coding at 11. I founded my first start-up at 16 (back in 2012, after dropping out of [Catholic High](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Catholic_High_School,_Singapore)) and eight months later it died. I began freelancing & working for different start-ups since then.

3. I was the lead developer & shareholder of a start-up that got on to TechCrunch Disrupt London 2016. Still, just like most start-ups eventually it died.

4. My initial plan was to skip university and go straight to grad school, considering in this day and age I can study virtually anything taught in undergrad classes at home with Internet and Amazon access. But being a Chinese passport holder I later ran into problems with Student Visa for graduate programs outside of China due to the lack of a Bachelor's degree. I'm not degree-oriented but I long for someday joining an academic community where I can find a sense of belonging. An identity. And hence the application to Yale-NUS.

5. I speak English, Cantonese, and Mandarin fluently. But most importantly, I run [Arch Linux](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Arch_is_the_best) and [spacemacs](http://spacemacs.org/) -)
