why don't I just kill myself?

death is a lovely little mistress

in a sexy dress carrying an illuminating lamp

I am a lustful man

I long to devour death


<br>

why don't I just kill myself?

pain is a petite little nympho

her sweet touches bring excitement and warmth

as blood rashes to the opening

loveliness radiates  

<br>

why don't I just kill myself?

agony is avant-garde

love is none-existent

hurt is nurturing

sadness is cute

<br>



<br>

why don't I just kill myself?

because I want to believe in the niceness in this world

I want to believe in the niceness of people

I want to believe in meaning

I want to make more meaningful connections with people

and with this world

<br>

I will leave

when I no longer find this world worthy of me
