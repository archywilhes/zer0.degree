Bizarre and Strange.

This 1992 sci-fi film blurs the 90s boundary between computer expressionism and the bold superimposition of computer graphics unto a screen depicting the real world or not depicting the real world at all and instead it goes pure CG. Mildly comical at times.  

Transiting between scenes of pure CG and partial CG (Augmented Reality) and no CG at all, [The Lawnmower Man](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/lawnmower_man) (directed by [Brett Leonard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brett_Leonard) and based on a Stephen King’s book sharing the same name) tells the story of the dichotomy nature of science research for humanity using the military budget with evil higher-ups that care only about wars and weapons perhaps as a representation that embodies the negative sentiment towards America’s ever-inflating defense budget, which could be largely due to the fact that 90s was the time in America where a large demographic in theirs twenties and thirties grew up listening or partaking in discussions about the Second Indochina War (1955-1975) and people's general distrust of the federal governments and the subsequent peace movements which eventually led to the ceasefire.

The film is ultimately a head-nod to French philosopher [Jean Baudrillard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jean_Baudrillard)'s notion of [hyperreality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simulacra_and_Simulation), though it was presented in a hyperbolical manner Baudrillard would certainly frown upon and it was done so through a medium that encapsulated more of 90s' popular understanding (or misunderstanding) of technology and computers and human intelligence and the mind, and ended up aligning pretty well with the popular culture while distorting and diluting the philosophy aspects of the film. It was one of the first films that helped to popularise the notion of Virtual Reality with VR goggles, full body tracking, etc, which made the film retain a somewhat cultural significance besides being just another equation-applying box-office starring Pierce Brosnan like most Hollywood productions. The amount of hype the film generated at that time motivated the same production company to spend $15 million on the production of a sequel which was aired 4 years later (See The Lawnmower Man 2: Beyond Cyberspace) and only received $2.4 million box office, roughly $30 million less than the original which took $10 million to produce.
