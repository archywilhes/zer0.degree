A neo-nostalgic documentary telling the story of a truly hipster Singaporean indie film produced in 1992 that was never finished and released. Composed with vintage footage of the old film that was recently recovered, [Shirkers](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shirkers) (directed and produced by [Sandi Tan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandi_Tan)) probes into a one-of-a-kind Singaporean adventure from days of yore.
