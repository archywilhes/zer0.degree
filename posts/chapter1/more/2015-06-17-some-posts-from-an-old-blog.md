These were some stuff I wrote roughly two years ago. At that time I was still an overly confident kid just like any other optimistic self-assured adolescents who have not seen the world or experienced anything outside of their comfort zone to realize how unrealistic the assumptions about reality upon many of their beliefs are based, preparing for his univ applications. I've changed quite a lot since then; I'm now an overly confident adult.

Mind you, they were pretty badly written. As a redditor would put it, "This guy is an intolerably bad writer, narcissistic and sophomoric and lacking real insights." And I agreed.
