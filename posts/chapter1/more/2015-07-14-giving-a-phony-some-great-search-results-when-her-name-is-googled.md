Phonies. The human species is full of them. I'm deeply disturbed when they entered the public domain and exploited the Internet to spread their bullshit.

A couple of weeks ago I stumbled upon [the Wikipedia entry of Dr. Manahel Thabet](http://web.archive.org/web/20150503224212/http://en.wikipedia.org:80/wiki/Manahel_Thabet) (Update: as of late 2015, it is [now deleted](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Special:Log/delete&page=Manahel_Thabet)).

Goolging her name showed that she has really great PRs. She even has [a verified twitter account with 50k followers.](https://twitter.com/manahelthabet)

Update: Oh, and an appearance on the front cover of Arabian Business! (Image taken from [an article by a Dubai blogger posted later this month](https://alexofarabia.com/2015/07/26/did-arabian-business-get-hoodwinked-by-the-arab-worlds-most-intelligent-person/))

But her achievements often sounded far-fetched. She had allegedly successfully predicted the 2008 financial crisis using a formula [as reported by Forbes Middle East](https://web.archive.org/web/20140512001100/https://www.forbesmiddleeast.com/en/news/read/article/magic-numbers/articleid/465) (Update: as of 2016, the article has been taken down ) and developed a formula to "measure distances in space in the absence of light" which had supposedly [taken the world by storm as reported by Gulfnews](https://web.archive.org/web/20150903004741/http://gulfnews.com:80/news/uae/general/dubai-woman-s-space-formula-takes-world-by-storm-1.1024095) (Update: as of 2016, the article has too been taken down too).

All claims made in the Wikipedia entry were supported by either news articles from presumably paid-to-write sources such as [arabianbusiness.com](http://web.archive.org/web/20150220000246/http://www.arabianbusiness.com/100-most-powerful-arab-women-2013-491497.html?view=profile&itemid=491330#.WxPpMlOFMWp), or crappy websites like [World Genius Directory](http://www.psiq.org/world_genius_directory_awards/goty2013manahelthabet.pdf), [iqsociety.org](www.iqsociety.org/win-people/manahel-thabet/) and [kauzala.com](http://www.kauzala.com/index.php?m=kauzala&s=leadership&p=dr-manahel-thabet).

I was highly skeptical about the whole thing. She felt more like a con artist. I should ask people on StackExchange about it, I thought. So I posted the following question: ["**Did Manahel Thabet develop a groundbreaking formula to measure distance in space without the use of light?**" ](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/q/27566).

It managed to gain quite some interest and [more people got into the investigation](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/a/27599) which eventually led to the deletion of her Wikipedia page. Great work, vigilantes on Skeptics.SE! I then submitted the post to the following subreddits: [/internetbullshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/internetbullshit/comments/34yjvh/manahel_thabet_a_phd_in_quantum_mathematics_and_a/) , [/skeptic](https://www.reddit.com/r/skeptic/comments/34xtk3/manahel_thabet_a_phd_in_quantum_mathematics_and_a/), [/quityourbullshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/quityourbullshit/comments/34rldx/manahel_thabet_a_phd_in_quantum_mathematics_and_a/), and also [cross-posted it in the subreddit /IsItBullshit](https://www.reddit.com/r/IsItBullshit/comments/34xusr/isitbullshit_manahel_thabet_a_phd_in_quantum/).

A few weeks later, the subreddit \[/IsItBullshit\] and Skeptics SE posts both made their way to [the first page of the Google search results for Manahel Thabet](https://www.google.com.sg/#q=Manahel+Thabet) in the shadow of the Wikiepdia entry which had been labeled "blatant hoax".

Many people dived in deeper.

Internet is a wonderful place.

> Fun fact: I just tweeted this article and mentioned her (<a href="https://twitter.com/manahelthabet">@manahelthabet</a>) in the tweet. I think she is going to block me like [what happened to the guy who asked her about the supposedly ground-breaking paper on Twitter](http://skeptics.stackexchange.com/questions/27566/did-manahel-thabet-develop-a-groundbreaking-formula-to-measure-distance-in-space#comment102663_27566).
