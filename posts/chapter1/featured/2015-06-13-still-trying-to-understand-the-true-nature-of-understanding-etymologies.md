To understand the nature of a particular human concept, it is often useful to take a look into the etymologies of the words used to convey the concept.

Among the most interesting human concepts is the concept of *understanding*.

The idea that standing in some position enables one to know some object better was the inspiration for many words in the Indo-European languages with meaning related to "understanding, getting to know something". That includes the [Old English](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Old_English) words [**forstandan**](https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=7UzoBQAAQBAJ&pg=PA154&lpg=PA154&dq=forstandan&source=bl&ots=oalHmPMXo-&sig=C-ALG8Tha-tEL6yruIjzM8Oqutg&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0CDcQ6AEwBWoVChMIzoCJx_6LxgIVx2KmCh3CdAIh#v=onepage&q=forstandan&f=false) (which eventually evolved into [**forstå**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/forstå) [Danish and Norwegian], [**förstå**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/förstå) [Swedish] , [verstehen](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/verstehen) [German], [**verstaan**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/verstaan#Dutch) [Dutch], etc.) and [**understandan**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/understandan) (that evolved into the English word **understand**).

It is likely that the prefix **for-** in **forstandan** means "in front of" (i.e. to stand before, to watch, observe, learn, and understand something). But we can't be exactly sure about that, just as how we are still unsure how the prefix **under-** should be interpreted in **understandan**. The prefix in Old English can mean both "under" and "between, among" (i.e. the word can be a metaphor for standing under something and getting to the bottom, or standing in the midst of things and getting to learn about the difference between them).

>It is also possible that the word **understandan** was formed by combining **forstandan** with **undirgi(e)tan** (which also means "understand"). To learn more about the etymology of the word **understand**, one can check out the book [*An Analytic Dictionary of English Etymology: An Introduction* by Anatoly Liberman](https://www.upress.umn.edu/book-division/books/an-analytic-dictionary-of-english-etymology). There is an entire chapter on it.

On the other hand, the Latin word [**comprehendere**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comprehendere) (meaning "to take together, to unite; include; seize" and "to comprehend, perceive"), formed by joining the prefix **com-** (for "completely") with **prehendere** (which means to catch hold of), is the etymon for [**comprendre**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comprendre) [Catalan and French], [**comprender**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comprender) [Interlingua and Spanish], [**comprendere**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/comprendere) [Italian], [**compreender**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/compreender) [Portuguese] and [not surprisingly](http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=comprehend), the English word **comprehend**. Here, instead of expressing the concept of *understanding* through a spacial idea (such as in the word **understandan** or **forstandan**), the concept was conveyed by the physical idea of taking hold of something, like the more abstract usage of **grasp** and **seize** (in "grasping the significance of something" and "seizing the truth").

Lastly, let's take a look at Chinese, Japanese, Korean and Vietnamese, which all use localised variations of the characters [**理解**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/理解) to represent the concept of *understanding*.

> Reads rikai (りかい) in Japanese, Lǐjiě in Mandarin, and lei<sup>5</sup> gaai<sup>2</sup> in Cantonese (sounding almost like Japanese).

> In the case of Korean and Vietnamese, **理解** is the [Hanja](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hanja) and [Chữ nôm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chữ_nôm) for [**이해**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/이해) (reads rihae) and [**lí giải**](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/l%C3%AD_gi%E1%BA%A3i#Vietnamese) respectively.

In [Classical Chinese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classical_Chinese), **理** was initially<sup>1</sup> the character for [jade carving](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardstone_carving). It was also used to express the tone and texture of jade, and later it was generalised<sup>2</sup>, and eventually it was used to describe the principle, the nature, the order, the [essence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Essence), the logic, the science, and (sometimes) the reason, of something.<sup>3</sup> The second character, **解**, initially<sup>4</sup> meant severing the horns of an ox, and later was generalised to mean “to separate, loosen; to remove (constraint), clear (confusion); to deconstruct.”

> <sup>1</sup> according to an extract from [<i>Shuowen Jiezi</i>, a 2nd-century Chinese dictionary from the Han Dynasty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shuowen_Jiezi): "理，治玉也。" (where 治玉 means jade carving.)
>
> <sup>2</sup> according to an extract from [<i>Xunzi</i>, an ancient Chinese collection of philosophical](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xunzi_(book)): "形體、色理以目異。" (English translation: The physical forms, colors and textures of things appear differently to different people.)
>
> <sup>3</sup> This is a simplified version of the story.
>
> <sup>4</sup> according to an extract from <i>Shuowen Jiezi</i>: "解：判也。从刀判牛角。" (where 判 means to cut, 刀 means knife, 牛 means ox, and 角 means horn.) As you can see the character 解 is composed of the characters 角, 刀 and 牛.


The more commonly used expression in Japanese is **わかる** (or **分かる**, both read Wa-ka-ru) , which is an alternative form for **解る** where **解** being the same loan word from Chinese and **る** a suffix for forming verbs. On the other hand, a commonly used word in Chinese for *understanding*, especially in everyday language, is **明白** ([which is used literarily in Japanese too](https://kotobank.jp/word/%E6%98%8E%E7%99%BD-643162)). And the characters literally mean bright or illuminating (**明**, made up of [**日**, the pictogram of sun](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%97%A5#Chinese), and [**月**, the picogram of moon](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E6%9C%88#Chinese)) and white or clear ([**白**, the pictogram of acorn, symbolising the colour of its fresh which is white](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E7%99%BD#Chinese)), expressing the idea akin to conveying that one is feeling enlightened.
