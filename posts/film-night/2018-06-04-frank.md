[Frank](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frank_2014/), directed by [Lenny Abrahamson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Abrahamson), explores the theme of creative process in music composition from the angle of a quasi-sociopath<sup>1</sup> (i.e. Jon in the movie) in an a-litte-bit-too-idealistic setting (where payrolls and shares are never mentioned once in the film). Not being in the music industry myself I would assume this remotely resembles reality. An overall enjoyable film still.

It reminds me a lot of an article on the dynamics and evolution of sub-culture I stumbled upon some years ago: [*Geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths in subculture evolution*](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths).

><sup>1</sup>: I am using the word "sociopath" here in the informal sense as expressed in [Venkatesh Rao's Gervais Principle](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=881296) (the same way the word is being used in [*Geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths in subculture evolution*](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths#footnote5_5n3eogi)), not a technical, clinical one.
