There is something surrealistically charismatic about a musically talented character in a papier-mâché head with big green eyes who turns out to be socially awkward.

[Frank](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frank_2014/), directed by [Lenny Abrahamson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Abrahamson), is a black comedy film exploring the themes of creative process in music composition, the interhuman relationship around it and social media marketing. An overall enjoyable film with *really* great vibes.

On the side note the film reminds me a lot of this article on the dynamics and evolution of sub-culture: [*Geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths in subculture evolution*](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths).
