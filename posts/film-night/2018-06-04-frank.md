There is something surrealistically charismatic about a musically talented character in a wooden head with big green eyes who is also socially awkward.

[Frank](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/frank_2014/), directed by [Lenny Abrahamson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenny_Abrahamson), is a black comedy film exploring the themes of creative process in music composition and social media marketing from the angle of a quasi-sociopath<sup>1</sup> (i.e. Jon in the movie) in an a-litte-bit-too-idealistic setting (where payrolls and shares are never once discussed in the film). Not being in the music industry myself I would assume this remotely resembles reality business-wise. Nonetheless an overall enjoyable film with *really* great vibes.

On the side note Frank reminds me a lot of this article on the dynamics and evolution of sub-culture: [*Geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths in subculture evolution*](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths).

><sup>1</sup>: I am using the word "sociopath" the same way the word is being used in [*Geeks, MOPs, and sociopaths in subculture evolution*](https://meaningness.com/geeks-mops-sociopaths#footnote5_5n3eogi), not a technical, clinical one.
