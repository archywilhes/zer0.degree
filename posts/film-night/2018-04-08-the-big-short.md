A Hollywood reenactment of [the 2010 documentary Inside Job](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/inside_job_2010). Through ironies and humour and pop culture references and [cameo appearances](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cameo_appearance) and occasional breaking of [the fourth wall](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_wall), [The Big Short](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_big_short) (directed and co-written by [Adam Mckay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_McKay)) tells the ugliest story of our times from the angles of a few elites who had foreseen the storm and took action by [shorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_(finance)) the market.

The scene transitions, the right moments when the music kicks in, the masterful portrayals of four different personalities, the [cinéma vérité](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cin%C3%A9ma_v%C3%A9rit%C3%A9), the jokes, and the occasional realisations of the seriousness in it make it all a tremendously enjoyable piece. An experience unlike any other films'.
