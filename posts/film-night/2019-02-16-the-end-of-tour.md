A re-enactment of the 1996 road trip interview between Rolling Stone reporter David Lipsky and legendary writer David Foster Wallace who was best known for his hysterical realism bestseller on the human condition, [Infinite Jest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_Jest), published in the same year. The End of the tour (directed by [James Ponsoldt](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Ponsoldt)) is a subtle and melancholic piece paying tributes to David Foster who committed suicide in 2008.
