Amid the silliness and quirkiness and symbolism and dramatisation is a heart-warming story about hopeless romanticism, one revolving around the idealism of meeting _the one_. Oh as the end credits rolled in and [Hollow Me by Yura Yura Teikoku](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9X7eVdxWlBw) began to play, I found myself started to cry.

ぼくの心をあなたは奪い去った

俺は空洞　でかい空洞

全て残らずあなたは奪い去った

俺は空洞　面白い

バカな子どもが　ふざけて駆け抜ける

俺は空洞　でかい空洞

> Oh and it ain't that I was moved by the story. Or anything like that. The lacrimal system simply began to function on its own. It was good.

[Love Exposure](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/love_exposure_2008/) (directed and written by [Sion Sono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sion_Sono)) is a four-hour-long melodramatic piece on family, love, and religion, and being a _pervert_ (or, in Japanese, a _hentai 「変態」_). A highly uncanny film and a slightly erotic and extremely enjoyable one.
