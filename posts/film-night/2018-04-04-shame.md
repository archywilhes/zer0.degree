Relationship. Marriage. Sex life. Pornography. Solitude. Kinship. Sadness. Desires. Fuck-ups. We all live our lives wanting something. Something preconceived by the mind with ill-formed lines, staying ambiguous throughout existence. Every time we fall we grow a little wiser. But we will never ever quite figure them out, won't we?

[Shame](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shame_2011/) (directed and co-written byÂ [Steve McQueen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McQueen_(director))) puts together a melancholic piece on the existential struggle of being human as we try to cope with our sexual desire and life itself. It has a bit of that [Edward Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper) vibe. And I love how every piano piece in it blends in pretty well with each scene, creating a great sense of neoclassicism.

A very good erotic film to watch for the ones who have slightly gotten used to a break-up but not quite life itself yet.
