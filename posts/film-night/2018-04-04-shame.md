Relationship. Marriage. Sex life. Pornography. Solitude. Kinship. Sadness. Desires. Fuck-ups. We all live our lives wanting something as we try to run away from something else. Both of which are preconceived by the mind with very ill-formed lines. They stay ambiguous throughout existence. Every time we fall we grow a little wiser but we will never ever quite figure out.

[Shame](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/shame_2011/) (directed and co-written byÂ [Steve McQueen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_McQueen_(director))) puts together a melancholic piece on the existential struggle of being human as we try to cope with our sexual desire and life itself. It has a bit of that [Edward Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Hopper) vibe and what I love the most is how every Bach piece in it blends in pretty well with each scene, creating a subtle touch to the overall composition.

A very good film to watch for the ones who have slightly gotten used to being single but not quite life itself.
