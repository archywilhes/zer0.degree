Strange and truly twisted. As a thriller [Strange Circus](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/strange_circus/) (written and directed by [Sion Sono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sion_Sono)) has exceeded my expectation in terms of the thrills the medium of film can bring to life. As the story unfolded itself into an end I came to a peculiar sense of appreciation for the reality in which I am as it is. I was glad that the film was over as much as I was glad that I sat through and experienced the whole piece from the beginning to end.
