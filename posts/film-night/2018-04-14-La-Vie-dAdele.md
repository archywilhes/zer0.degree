Masterfully executed, with shots and scenes that would bring back memories in ways you could never quite put into words as they linger in your mind for days to come, [Blue is the Warmest Colour](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/blue_is_the_warmest_color/) (directed, co-written and co-produced by [Abdellatif Kechiche](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abdellatif_Kechiche)) tells the coming-of-age story of Adèle, a high school girl from a middle-class family who met and fell in love with Emma, a graduating art student, and their life together, and the inevitable divergence later on  .
