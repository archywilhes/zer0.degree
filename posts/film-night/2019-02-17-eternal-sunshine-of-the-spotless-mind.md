Emotional, surreal and sentimental. Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind (written by [Charlie Kaufman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Kaufman) and directed by [Michel Gondry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michel_Gondry)) is a sci-fi love story exploring the theme of a future technology capable of deleting memories of a past love and its human implications in regards to hopeless romanticism and the self-conflicting tendencies of human nature. In essence it depicts a thought experiment about love and our love-hate relationship with memories in association with a past lover.

What is I find particularly interesting about Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind is the intriguing story-telling both plot and cinematography-wise as a 2014 film.
